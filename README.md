Sample data generator library.  \
The motivation to create this project was the high number of limitations for similar web apps in the free tier. This is easy to run locally, at Jupyter or even have it as a library for other projects.

# Features

This is a library to help with sample data generation in a number of different ways:
> - Modular generators to help you get single random values
> - Full-scope class to generate batches of data
> - Modular writers to have your sample data writen directly into the most popular formats.

# Usage

There are usage examples [here](./examples/).

# Roadmap
